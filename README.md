My Awesome Machine Learning ProjectThis repository contains a Google Colab notebook for a machine learning project, leveraging a T4 GPU for efficient model training and inference. The project likely involves working with large models, as indicated by the .safetensors files.Table of ContentsFeaturesSetupUsageContributingLicenseFeaturesGPU Accelerated: Designed to run efficiently on Google Colab's T4 GPUs.Python 3 Environment: Built with standard Python 3 libraries.Large Model Handling: Optimized for working with substantial machine learning models (e.g., via safetensors).SetupTo get started with this project, you'll primarily use Google Colab.Open in Google Colab:The easiest way to run this project is to open the .ipynb notebook directly in Google Colab.(Remember to replace YOUR_USERNAME, YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME, and YOUR_NOTEBOOK_NAME.ipynb with your actual GitHub details and notebook file name.)Local Setup (Optional):If you prefer to run this project locally, ensure you have Python 3.x installed and a compatible GPU if you wish to utilize GPU acceleration.# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # for PyTorch with CUDA 11.8
# pip install transformers datasets accelerate safetensors

You will also need to install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the .ipynb file:pip install notebook  # or pip install jupyterlab
jupyter notebook      # or jupyter lab

UsageOnce the notebook is open in Google Colab (or locally), you can run the cells sequentially.Connect to a GPU Runtime: In Google Colab, go to Runtime > Change runtime type and select T4 GPU under Hardware accelerator.Run Cells: Execute each cell in the notebook. The notebook will guide you through the process, which may include:Installing necessary libraries.Downloading model weights or datasets.Loading and preparing data.Running model inference or training.Visualizing results.ContributingContributions are welcome!
